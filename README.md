# Vector2d

Class with operator overloading for dealing with graphics and game programming. Made for my own use. Considered making it a template class 
but for my use, it was unneccessary. Although pixel drawing isn't based on decimal numbers, for accuracy in the physics, it was important
to ensure that the real values were kept. Therefore, only doubles are needed.
